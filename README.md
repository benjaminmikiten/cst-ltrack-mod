# CST L-Trac 2545-5W Trackball Switch Mod
Descibes a mod to the CST2545-5W Trackball to add two switches to the 1.3v PCB. These can be your button 4 and 5 on this trackball.

The popular [/u/ripster55](https://www.reddit.com/user/ripster55) [mod](https://imgur.com/a/bhicE) describes an earlier PCB with a different location of the extra switch solder pads.

## J3, J4 Solder Pads

On the v1.3 revision they are located on the right side of the PCB, labled J3, J4. 

## Solder Wires to the PCB

You will need to drill a hole in the back for the wires to escape the chassis. 

## Attaching Switches

Solder the ends of the wires onto the switch you're using. Be careful not to burn the insulation of the wires like I did.

## Switch Enclosure
I 3D Printed mine from a file I found on [Thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2421998) by user [AnEnemyAnemone](https://www.thingiverse.com/AnEnemyAnemone/about) (thank you!).

I chose to epoxy my housing directly to the chassis of the trackball as I am incredibly foolhearty.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trackballs/comments/82uny1/cst_mod_posted_earlier/) on reddit has photos of a version of this same housing but with a backing that would allow you to use simply double-stick tape. You can find the files for this housing on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/cst-trackball-2-button-add-on-1)
